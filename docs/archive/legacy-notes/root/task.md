# Ecommerce Website Completion Roadmap

This document outlines the necessary tasks to complete the ecommerce website project, moving it from its current state to a production-ready application. The tasks are organized into phases, starting with foundational improvements and progressing to feature completion and deployment.

## Phase 1: Foundational Improvements (Stabilization & Developer Experience)

*This phase focuses on addressing the biggest risks and improving the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.*

### 1.1. Backend Enhancements
- [ ] **Implement Comprehensive Testing:**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for all services in `backend/src/services`. Aim for >80% coverage.
  - [ ] Write integration tests for all API endpoints in `backend/src/controllers`.
  - [ ] Set up a test database to run tests in isolation.
- [ ] **Refine Prisma Schema:**
  - [ ] Convert all `String`-based enums (e.g., `User.role`, `Order.status`) to native Prisma `enum` types for better data integrity.
  - [ ] Refactor comma-separated string fields (`Product.features`, `Technician.specialties`) into related tables for better querying.
- [ ] **Improve Error Handling & Logging:**
  - [ ] Integrate the `logger.ts` utility throughout the services and controllers.
  - [ ] Create a centralized error handling middleware that returns structured error responses. Avoid exposing stack traces in production.
- [ ] **Add Input Validation:**
  - [ ] Ensure every route that accepts a request body has robust validation rules using `express-validator`.

### 1.2. Frontend Enhancements
- [ ] **Establish a Testing Strategy:**
  - [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration testing of components.
  - [ ] Write tests for critical components like `AddToCartButton`, `LoginForm`, and checkout forms.
  - [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows (e.g., login, add to cart, checkout) using a framework like Cypress or Playwright.
- [ ] **Refactor Component Structure:**
  - [ ] Organize the `frontend/src/components` directory into subfolders based on feature (e.g., `products`, `checkout`, `common`) or component type (e.g., `ui`, `forms`).
  - [ ] Break down large page components (like `products/page.tsx`) into smaller, reusable child components.
- [ ] **Consolidate State Management:**
  - [ ] Review the use of Context and `cartStore.ts`.
  - [ ] Decide on a primary global state management library (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit) and refactor existing state logic to use it consistently. Use React Context only for localized, non-complex state.

### 1.3. General
- [ ] **Enhance Documentation:**
  - [ ] Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file explaining how to set up the project, run tests, and contribute code.
  - [ ] Document all API endpoints. Consider using Swagger or OpenAPI to generate interactive documentation.

## Phase 2: Feature Completion & UI Polish

*This phase focuses on building out the missing features and ensuring a consistent, high-quality user experience.*

### 2.1. Core User-Facing Features
- [ ] **Complete Static Pages:**
  - [ ] Build the `About Us`, `Contact Us`, and other placeholder pages.
- [ ] **Product Details Page:**
  - [ ] Create a full-featured product details page (`/products/[slug]`) showing all images, description, specifications, reviews, and related products.
- [ ] **Complete Checkout Flow:**
  - [ ] Implement the multi-step checkout process (shipping address, payment method, order summary).
  - [ ] Integrate with a real payment gateway.
- [ ] **User Dashboard:**
  - [ ] Build out the customer dashboard sections (order history, manage addresses, profile settings).
- [ ] **Search Functionality:**
  - [ ] Implement a fully functional search bar that provides instant results.

### 2.2. Admin Panel
- [ ] **CRUD Operations:**
  - [ ] Ensure all management panels (Products, Orders, Customers, etc.) have fully functional Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
  - [ ] Implement features like image uploads for products.
- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard:**
  - [ ] Connect the analytics dashboard to real data from the backend `analyticsService`.

### 2.3. UI/UX Polish
- [ ] **Remove Mock Data:**
  - [ ] Purge all hardcoded mock data from frontend components and rely exclusively on API calls.
- [ ] **Implement Loading & Error States:**
  - [ ] Ensure all data-fetching components have clear loading indicators (e.g., skeletons, spinners).
  - [ ] Display user-friendly error messages when API calls fail.
- [ ] **Responsive Design:**
  - [ ] Thoroughly test and fix styling issues on all major screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n):**
  - [ ] Ensure all user-facing text is sourced from the `ar.json` and `fr.json` files.

## Phase 3: Deployment & Production Readiness

*This phase focuses on preparing the application for a live environment.*

- [ ] **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - [ ] Create a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) that automatically runs tests, linting, and builds for every pull request.
  - [ ] Configure a deployment script to push the frontend and backend to your hosting provider.
- [ ] **Production Database:**
  - [ ] Migrate the Prisma schema from SQLite to a production-grade database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- [ ] **Environment Variables:**
  - [ ] Ensure all secrets (API keys, database URLs, JWT secrets) are managed securely through environment variables and are not hardcoded.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization:**
  - [ ] Optimize frontend assets (images, scripts) for faster load times.
  - [ ] Add database indexes for frequently queried columns to improve backend performance.
- [ ] **Security Hardening:**
  - [ ] Review all dependencies for known vulnerabilities (`npm audit`).
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (e.g., login, password reset).
  - [ ] Ensure all security headers are correctly set in the backend middleware.
