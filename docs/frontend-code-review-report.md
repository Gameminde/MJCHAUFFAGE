## üö® Critical Issues

### 1. **Dependency Bloat & Security Risks**
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Bundle size, security vulnerabilities, maintenance burden

**Issues Found:**
- **Unused Dependencies:** Multiple packages in `package.json` appear unused
  - `critters` (0.0.23) - CSS inlining, likely unused
  - `google-auth-library` - Google auth, but project uses custom JWT
  - `puppeteer` - Headless browser, only used in some tests
  - `node-fetch` - Polyfill, not needed in Node 18+
  - `iron-session` - Session management, conflicts with custom auth
  - `react-query` - TanStack Query, conflicts with custom data fetching
  - `react-hot-toast` - Toast notifications, may conflict with custom UI

**Recommendation:**
```bash
npm uninstall critters google-auth-library puppeteer node-fetch iron-session react-query
```

### 2. **Authentication Architecture Confusion**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Security, maintainability, user experience

**Issues Found:**
- Multiple auth systems configured simultaneously:
  - `@auth/prisma-adapter` + `next-auth` in dependencies
  - Custom JWT auth in services
  - `iron-session` for session management
  - `PublicAuthContext.tsx` vs backend auth

**Recommendation:** Choose ONE auth system. Prefer NextAuth.js for simplicity or custom JWT for full control.

### 3. **Inconsistent State Management**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Code maintainability, performance

**Issues Found:**
- **Zustand** used for cart (`cartStore.ts`)
- **React Context** used for auth (`PublicAuthContext.tsx`)
- **Custom hooks** for other state
- **React Query** in dependencies but not used consistently

**Recommendation:** Standardize on Zustand for all client state, remove conflicting libraries.

## üîç Code Quality Issues

### 4. **Dead Code & Unused Files**
**Severity:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Impact:** Bundle size, maintenance confusion

**Files to Remove:**
- `src/pages/_document.tsx` - Legacy pages router, not needed in App Router
- `src/store/cartStore.ts` - Has extensive cart logic, but check if all methods are used
- `scripts/scan-api-calls.ps1` - PowerShell script, may be development-only
- `test-app.ps1` - Development script, not needed in production

**Unused Components:** Need to verify usage of:
- Some admin components may be unused
- Legacy comparison components
- Accessibility components (partially implemented)

### 5. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** User experience, debugging

**Issues Found:**
- API errors handled differently across services
- Some components lack error boundaries
- Error messages not internationalized
- No consistent error logging strategy

**Recommendation:** Implement centralized error handling with Sentry integration.

### 6. **Performance Concerns**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** User experience, SEO

**Issues Found:**
- **Large bundle size potential** with multiple UI libraries
- **No code splitting** visible in main components
- **Heavy images** without proper optimization
- **Missing lazy loading** for non-critical components
- **Synchronous API calls** in SSR functions

**Recommendations:**
- Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
- Add proper image optimization pipeline
- Use React.lazy for route-based code splitting
- Implement proper caching strategies

### 7. **Accessibility Issues**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Legal compliance, user experience

**Issues Found:**
- Basic accessibility features implemented but incomplete
- Missing ARIA labels in some components
- Color contrast ratios not verified
- Keyboard navigation partially implemented
- Screen reader support needs improvement

**Recommendations:**
- Complete accessibility audit with automated tools
- Implement proper focus management
- Add comprehensive ARIA labels
- Test with screen readers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Issues

### 8. **Component Architecture Problems**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Code maintainability, reusability

**Issues Found:**
- **Inconsistent component patterns** - mix of class and functional components
- **Large components** - some components exceed 500 lines
- **Tight coupling** between components and services
- **Missing separation of concerns** in some admin components

**Specific Issues:**
- `ProductsManagement.tsx` - 900+ lines, needs refactoring
- Mixed styling approaches (CSS modules, Tailwind, inline styles)

### 9. **API Layer Issues**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Data fetching reliability

**Issues Found:**
- **Inconsistent API response handling**
- **Mixed fetch strategies** (native fetch vs axios)
- **No request deduplication**
- **Missing API versioning strategy**

**Recommendations:**
- Standardize on single HTTP client
- Implement request/response interceptors
- Add proper error boundaries for API calls

### 10. **Testing Gaps**
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Code reliability, regression prevention

**Issues Found:**
- **Incomplete test coverage**
- **Mixed testing frameworks** (Jest + Vitest)
- **Missing integration tests** for critical flows
- **No visual regression tests**

**Recommendations:**
- Consolidate on single testing framework (Vitest preferred)
- Add comprehensive integration tests
- Implement visual testing with Playwright
- Add performance testing
