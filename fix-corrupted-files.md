# Fix Corrupted Files

The files have syntax corruption from multiple edits. Here's how to fix:

## Quick Fix

Run this in the frontend directory:

```bash
# Delete the corrupted lines manually and rebuild
code src/components/admin/ProductsManagement.tsx
# Go to lines 96-99 and replace with the clean version below
```

## Clean Version for ProductsManagement.tsx (lines 92-100)

```typescript
  // Real-time updates (DISABLED - WebSocket not configured yet)
  // const { 
  //   onProductCreated, 
  //   onProductUpdated, 
  //   onProductDeleted, 
  //   notifyProductChange,
  //   isConnected,
  //   cleanup 
  // } = useProductRealtime()

  useEffect(() => {
```

Delete lines 96-99 completely and replace with just the commented code above.

## OR: Restore from VSCode

1. Open `ProductsManagement.tsx` in VSCode
2. Press Ctrl+Z multiple times to undo the bad edits
3. Or use "File > Discard Changes" if you have git
