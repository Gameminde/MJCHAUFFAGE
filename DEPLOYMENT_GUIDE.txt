# MJ CHAUFFAGE - DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION GUIDE

## 1. BACKEND (Render.com)
Set these Environment Variables in your Render Dashboard:

FRONTEND_URL = https://mj-chauffage-frontend.netlify.app
DATABASE_URL = (Your PostgreSQL URL)
JWT_SECRET   = (Generate a long random string)
PORT         = 3001

## 2. FRONTEND (Netlify)
Set these Environment Variables in your Netlify Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://mj-chauffage-backend.onrender.com
NEXTAUTH_URL        = https://mj-chauffage-frontend.netlify.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET     = (Generate a secure random string, use: openssl rand -base64 32)

## 3. DEPLOYMENT STEPS
1. The backend code has been updated to explicitly allow requests from your Netlify domain.
2. The Netlify configuration (netlify.toml) has been reset to the root directory.
3. Pushing these changes to GitHub will trigger a new build on Netlify.
4. Ensure your backend on Render redeploys with the latest code (you might need to trigger a manual deploy on Render if auto-deploy isn't set).
