# 🚀 Quick Start - Backend is Ready!

## ✅ All Fixed! Start Your Server Now:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\youcefcheriet\MJCHAUFFAGE\backend
npm run dev
```

---

## 🔐 Login Credentials

```
Email: admin@mjchauffage.com
Password: Admin@123
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| JWT_SECRET too short (< 64 chars) | ✅ Now 128 chars (512 bits) |
| JWT_REFRESH_SECRET too short | ✅ Now 128 chars (512 bits) |
| SESSION_SECRET too short | ✅ Now 128 chars (512 bits) |
| Schema = PostgreSQL, URL = SQLite | ✅ Both now SQLite |
